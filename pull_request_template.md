Add your repo! 

To get it merged quickly, please check:

* [ ] You modified sites.md, not README.md (which is auto-generated each night)
* [ ] You provided the full url, ala `https://github.com/myname/myrepo` with no trailing slash at the end of the url
* [ ] The description is short n' sweet
* [ ] There's no period on the end of the description
* [ ] You didn't add extra newlines

You can add a gitlab or other url, but only github repositories currently show stars and licenses.
