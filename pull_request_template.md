Add your code! To get it merged quickly, double check:

* [] You provided the full url, ala `https://github.com/myname/myrepo`
* [] No trailing slash on the end of the url
* [] The description is short n' sweet
* [] There's no period on the end of the description
* [] You didn't add extra newlines

You can add a gitlab or other url, but only github repositories currently show stars and licenses.
